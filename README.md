## OBJECTIVES
	• The main objective of the project is to Automate software testing tasks on Amazon: Develop scripts to automate 
       specific functionalities on the Amazon platform, demonstrating the power of Selenium in a real-world context.
	• Automate Login Process: Streamline and ensure accuracy in the Amazon login process using automated scripts.
	• Enhance Product Search: Automate the product search functionality to quickly and accurately find products using 
     given keywords.
	• Automate Product Selection: Select and display details of a random product from search results to verify the 
     product's availability and information.
	• Streamline Checkout: Automate the process of proceeding to checkout, reducing manual effort and errors.
	• Develop Comprehensive Test Cases: Create unit test cases for each automated step to ensure functionality and 
     reliability.
    Integrate Test Suite: Combine all test cases into a single, integrated test suite to validate the end-to-end 
     process efficiently.

## LIMITATIONS
	• The automation script may not handle CAPTCHA or other advanced security measures.
	• Limited to the functionality provided by Selenium WebDriver.
	• Dependent on the stability and layout of the Amazon website, which may change over time.
## PROJECT SCOPE
The scope of this project includes:

	• Automating the login process on Amazon.
	• Searching for a product using a given keyword.
	• Selecting and displaying a random product from the search results.
	• Adding the selected product to the shopping cart.
	• Proceeding to the checkout page.
	• Creating unit test cases for each step and an integrated test case 
     covering the entire process.
	• Analysing the test results and generating comprehensive test reports.
